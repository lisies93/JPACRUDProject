# JPACRUDProject

This project calls on us to make a simple full stack application delivering basic CRUD functionality for at least one table. For this specific project I've created a Spring boot app that allows a user to retrieve a list of the best retro video games of all time via a MySQL database.

### Topics & Technologies


MySQL, MySQL Workbench

JPA/Hibernate

Spring Boot

Spring Data JPA

Git/Github

Gradle

HTML

JUnit testing

MAMP


### How to Run

This project involved creating a database with a few entries. Creating a Java entity class and mapping the POJO using JPA.
The user will be able to perform full CRUD operations.

Create a new game record.
Retrieve a list of games by keyword or a single game by ID.
Update any of the games.
Delete any game from the database.


### Lessons Learned

Personally this was my favorite project so far! I had so much working with the database and front end. For the CRUD functionality i would say it was not much of a challenge since it was pretty much the same logic from the past project just implementing them with new tools that make everything so much easier. I can say that i am very happy and proud of what i am able to do so far.
